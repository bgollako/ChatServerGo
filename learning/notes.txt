Go is pass by value language
Value types:
int, float, string, bool, structs
Use pointers while passing these to functions
Reference types:
slice, map, channel, pointers, functions
Need not use pointers while passing to function

Slices point to an underlying array
Slicing an array or slice creates a new slice, pointing to the original array
